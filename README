This jQuery plugin is an extended version of Phil Palmieris work; http://philpalmieri.com/2009/09/jquery-session-auto-timeout-with-prompt/

My extension is listening to the jQuery event ajaxSend so that the timeout is reset when other ajax requests are sent (assuming they will reset the session timeout on the server)
